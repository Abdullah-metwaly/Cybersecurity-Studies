> In discussing the latest vulnerabilities, we will focus this section and the following ones on one of the previously shown attacks and present it as simply as possible without going into too much technical detail. This should help us facilitate the concept of the attack through an example related to a specific service to gain a better understanding.

> In this case, we will discuss the `CoreFTP before build 727` vulnerability assigned [CVE-2022-22836](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22836). This vulnerability is for an FTP service that does not correctly process the `HTTP PUT` request and leads to an `authenticated directory`/`path traversal,` and `arbitrary file write` vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to write files outside the directory to which the service has access.

## The Concept of the Attack

>This FTP service uses an HTTP `POST` request to upload files. However, the CoreFTP service allows an HTTP `PUT` request, which we can use to write content to files. Let's have a look at the attack based on our concept. The [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50652) for this attack is relatively straightforward, based on a single `cURL` command
#### CoreFTP Exploitation

```
$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
```

>We create a raw HTTP `PUT` request (`-X PUT`) with basic auth (`--basic -u <username>:<password>`), the path for the file (`--path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../whoops`), and its content (`--data-binary "PoC."`) with this command. Additionally, we specify the host header (`-H "Host: <IP>"`) with the IP address of our target system.


```c
C:\> type C:\whoops
```
