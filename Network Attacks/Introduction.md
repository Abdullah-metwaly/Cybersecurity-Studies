# Intermediate Network Traffic Analysis Overview

The importance of mastering network traffic analysis in our fast-paced, constantly evolving, and intricate network environments cannot be overstated. Confronted with an overwhelming volume of traffic traversing our network infrastructure, it can feel daunting. Our potential to feel ill-equipped or even overwhelmed is an inherent challenge we must overcome.

In this module, our focus will be on an extensive set of attacks that span crucial components of our network infrastructure. We will delve into attacks that take place on the link layer, the IP layer, and the transport and network layers. Our exploration will even encompass attacks that target the application layer. The goal is to discern patterns and trends within these attacks. Recognizing these patterns equips us with the essential skills to detect and respond to these threats in an efficacious manner.
