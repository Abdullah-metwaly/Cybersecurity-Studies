>In the domain of traffic analysis, it is invariably critical to scrutinize all aspects of link-layer protocols and communications. A prominent type of link-layer attack is the one directed at `802.11 (Wi-Fi)`. Such an attack vector is often easy for us to disregard, but given that human errors can lead to the failure of our perimeter security, it is essential that we continually audit our wireless networks.

## Capturing 802.11 Traffic

>To examine our 802.11 raw traffic, we would require a `WIDS`/`WIPS` system or a wireless interface equipped with monitor mode. Similar to promiscuous mode in Wireshark, monitor mode permits us to view raw 802.11 frames and other packet types which might otherwise remain invisible.

```
$ iwconfig
```
#iwconfig

```
$ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Found 2 processes that could cause trouble.
Kill them using 'airmon-ng check kill' before putting
the card in monitor mode, they will interfere by changing channels
and sometimes putting the interface back in managed mode

```
#airmon-ng

	we would need to deactivate our interface, modify its mode, and then reactivate it.
```
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
$sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

	We could verify if our interface is in `monitor mode` using the `iwconfig` utility.

```
$ iwconfig

```

`To commence capturing traffic from our clients and network, we can employ `airodump-ng`. We need to specify our AP's channel with `-c`, its BSSID with `--bssid`, and the output file name with `-w`.
```
$ sudo airodump-ng -c 4 --bssid F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1 wlan0 -w raw

## How Deauthentication Attacks Work

Among the more frequent attacks we might witness or detect is a deauthentication/dissociation attack. This is a commonplace link-layer precursor attack that adversaries might employ for several reasons:

1. To capture the WPA handshake to perform an offline dictionary attack
2. To cause general denial of service conditions
3. To enforce users to disconnect from our network, and potentially join their network to retrieve information

In most scenarios, basic tools like `aireplay-ng` and `mdk4` employ reason `code 7` for deauthentication.

### Finding Deauthentication Attacks 

>If we wanted to limit our view to traffic from our AP's BSSID (`MAC`), we could use the following Wireshark filter:


- wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

![Filtering to our BSSID](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/229/1-deauth.png)

>>With this filter, we specify the type of frame (`management`) with `00` and the subtype (`deauthentication`) with `12`.

- (wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12)
- (wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 7)
- (wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 1)

>Alternatively, a more sophisticated actor might attempt to evade this innately obvious sign by revolving reason codes. The principle to this, is that an attacker might try to evade any alarms that they could set off with a wireless intrusion detection system by changing the reason code every so often.


As such, deauthentication can be a pain to deal with, but we have some compensating measures that we can implement to prevent this from occuring in the modern day and age. These are:

1. Enable IEEE 802.11w (Management Frame Protection) if possible
2. Utilize WPA3-SAE
3. Modify our WIDS/WIPS detection rules


#### Finding Failed Authentication Attempts

Suppose an attacker was to attempt to connect to our wireless network. We might notice an excessive amount of association requests coming from one device. To filter for these we could use the following.

- (wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 11)
